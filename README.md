Event Registration System

Software Configuration Management (SCM) Mini Project

Overview

The Event Registration System is a lightweight web application developed to demonstrate core Software Configuration Management (SCM) practices using Git and GitHub.
The project focuses on configuration control, traceability, and disciplined change management, rather than feature complexity.

Key SCM Features

Software Configuration Management Plan (SCMP)

Configuration Item (CI) identification and tracking

Git-based version control with branching

Formal Change Request (CR) process

Baseline management (BL1, BL2)

Release management (v1.0, v1.1)

Physical & Functional Configuration Audits

Tech Stack

HTML

CSS

JavaScript

Git & GitHub

Repository Structure

Version Control Workflow

main branch holds stable versions

Feature branches used for development

Changes merged via Pull Requests

Commits are descriptive and traceable

Baselines & Releases

BL1: Initial setup and documentation

BL2: Working system with approved changes

v1.0: Initial working release

v1.1: Improved release after CR implementation

Change Management

All changes are controlled using formal Change Requests (CRs) and recorded in the Change Log.
Only approved CRs are implemented and merged.

Configuration Audit

PCA: Verifies documentation and repository consistency

FCA: Verifies implemented functionality against requirements

Audit results are documented and available in the repository.
