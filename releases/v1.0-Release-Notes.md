# Release Notes — v1.0 (Initial Working System)

**Project:** Mini / Campus Event Registration System  
**Release Tag:** v1.0  
**Release Date:** 2025-12-29  
**Baseline Reference:** BL2 (working prototype)

## Summary
Initial working release of a client-side event registration system using HTML/CSS/JS and browser `localStorage`.

## Included Features
- User authentication:
  - Sign up (stores users in `localStorage`)
  - Login (session stored in `localStorage`)
  - Password hashing with SHA-256 + per-user salt (client-side)
- Dashboard:
  - View events list
  - Search events
  - Event details modal
- Event management:
  - Create event (optional image upload + resize)
  - Owner-only edits (image and description)
- Registration:
  - Register/unregister flow
  - Prevent duplicate registration
  - Prevent self-registration (owner cannot register their own event)
  - “My Registered Events” with counter in navigation

## Data Storage (localStorage keys)
- `ers_users` — array of user records
- `ers_session` — active session record
- `ers_events` — array of events
- `ers_registrations` — object map `{ userId: [eventIds] }`

## Known Limitations
- No backend/server-side security (client-side only).
- Data is per-browser (clearing storage removes users/events/registrations).
- No automated test suite (manual smoke checks only).

## Upgrade / Installation Notes
1. Open `src/login.html` in a browser.
2. Create an account via `src/signup.html`.
3. Use dashboard to view/register events.

## Verification (Manual Smoke Checklist)
- Sign up works and redirects to dashboard
- Login works with valid credentials
- Logout clears session and redirects to login
- Create event adds event and returns to events list
- Register button works and prevents duplicate/self registration
- “My Registered Events (N)” count updates
